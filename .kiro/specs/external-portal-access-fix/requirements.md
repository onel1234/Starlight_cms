# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical access issues that customers and suppliers are experiencing when logging into their respective dashboards in the construction management system. The current implementation has authentication and routing infrastructure in place, but there are gaps in the user experience, error handling, and access control that prevent external users from successfully accessing their portals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to be able to log into my dashboard without encountering access errors, so that I can view my projects and communicate with the construction company.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them successfully
2. WHEN a customer is authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the customer portal dashboard
3. WHEN a customer accesses any customer portal route THEN the system SHALL verify their role and grant access
4. IF a customer encounters an authentication error THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN a customer's session expires THEN the system SHALL provide a clear notification and redirect to login

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a supplier, I want to be able to log into my dashboard without encountering access errors, so that I can view available tenders, submit quotations, and manage my orders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a supplier enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them successfully
2. WHEN a supplier is authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the supplier portal dashboard
3. WHEN a supplier accesses any supplier portal route THEN the system SHALL verify their role and grant access
4. IF a supplier encounters an authentication error THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN a supplier's session expires THEN the system SHALL provide a clear notification and redirect to login

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an external user (customer or supplier), I want clear feedback when I encounter access issues, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to resolve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an external user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message
2. WHEN an external user's account is inactive THEN the system SHALL display an account status message
3. WHEN an external user tries to access a route they don't have permission for THEN the system SHALL display a role-specific access denied message
4. WHEN there are network or service errors THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with retry options
5. WHEN an external user encounters any error THEN the system SHALL provide contact information for support

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure that external users can only access their designated portal areas, so that security and data isolation are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer is authenticated THEN the system SHALL only allow access to customer portal routes
2. WHEN a supplier is authenticated THEN the system SHALL only allow access to supplier portal routes
3. WHEN an external user tries to access internal system routes THEN the system SHALL deny access and redirect appropriately
4. WHEN an external user's session is invalid THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication data and redirect to login
5. WHEN role verification fails THEN the system SHALL log the security event and deny access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an external user, I want my login session to be managed properly, so that I don't get unexpectedly logged out or face session-related access issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an external user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL establish a secure session with appropriate expiration
2. WHEN an external user's session is about to expire THEN the system SHALL provide a warning with option to extend
3. WHEN an external user is inactive for the session timeout period THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out
4. WHEN an external user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL maintain their authenticated state if session is valid
5. WHEN an external user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session data and redirect to login page
